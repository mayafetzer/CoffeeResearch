A repository to hold the code and data files used in the coffee freshness research conducted at Bucknell University under Dr. Kat Wakabayashi.

# Research Overview and Purpose
The Specialty Coffee Association (SCA) claims that coffee tastes different as it ages. This is something that consumers have also recognized in their product, as old coffee beans or grounds are known to taste dull or bitter. In the third wave coffee industry, coffee products are created from one specific strain of coffee, and are often hand-picked to ensure that the best product reaches a consumer. In this branch of the coffee world, the beans are not blended together with other species of coffee, so the specific flavor notes of the brew can shine through without competing with other flavors. Maintaining these flavors and understanding their decay is key to the economic and social preservation of third-wave coffee shops and farmers.

The SCA further claims that CO2 off gassing from roasted beans is the primary driving force that causes aging to occur. This CO2 leaving the beans explains the dull flavor that arises because the off gassing will carry off volitile aromatics, whose smell and taste are responsible for the flavor profile of coffee. However, this does not explain other aspects of aging in coffee beans. 


Having a full and comprehensive understanding of how coffee ages will allow for a better process for storing and selling coffee beans, preventing waste and sustaining the third-wave coffee industry.
