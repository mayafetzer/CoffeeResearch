# Research Overview and Purpose

As coffee ages, it loses key physical and chemical characteristics that are responsible for how it tastes fresh. The trend of how coffee ages (model for a rate of decay), as well as
what specifically changes when coffee ages, is currently unknown. The goal of this project is to create a machine learning platform that can analyze the data collected of the chemical
and physical traits of coffee and predict the age of the sample. This model can be used by roasters to help predict how old their coffee can be before it needs to be sold. The goal
of this model is to reduce the environmental and economic impacts of the coffee industry by reducing the waste produced by prematurely disposing of the coffee beans.
